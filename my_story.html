          <h2>What's Your Story?</h5>
          <p>
            Like many high schoolers, I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I 
            wasn't a straight A student, and I mainly found myself questioning the purpose 
            of learning such useless information at school such as the atomic number of carbon 
            when I knew I wasn't going to become a chemist of any sort. I always did above average 
            but never more. Even if my parents didn't tell me, I knew they expected 
            highly of me. My father being a self-made business owner who provides for our family 
            and my mother graduating with a masters in Art at a top private university in Korea, 
            I felt an overwhelming pressure to make them proud. Its every Asian parents dream for 
            their child to become a successful doctor or lawyer, but I knew that wasn't 
            what I wanted. I thought I could become some sort of business man like my father and 
            maybe that would be enough. I also felt I was drawn to the business field because 
            I knew the University of Georgia had a good business college, Terry College of Business, 
            so I was also probably driven by that as well. I know it sounds pathetic, but this was 
            the kind of above-average person I was when I was sixteen years old.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent my first year in college completely clueless in what I wanted to study. I was 
            admitted with the major "Business", but didn't really know what I wanted to do. It only 
            took one conversation with a stranger to convince me to go towards the "Management Information 
            Systems" or MIS field. I was sort of drawn to do something that had to do with technology as 
            I was often spending time with technology in my free time such as video games, youtube videos, 
            and social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my second year, I was expected to submit an application to the Terry College of Business 
            with my inteded area of study with essays explaining why. I was split between relieved and 
            disappointed when I found I was accepted but only for an intended area of study for "Management". 
            I was told that my background as a youth director in church and leader in clubs made me more 
            suited to do Management and if I wanted to reapply as an MIS, I would have to try again next 
            semester. I was scared of what my friends and family would think if I had told them I failed 
            to be admitted and had to take an extra semester to graduate. I also disliked the idea of 
            wasting time. I decided to trust my counselor and also believed that I was capable of 
            doing something with management.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I took Management courses, I found myself doing well, but also realizing my lack of 
            enthusiasm and motivation to learn. I started to question if I had chosen the right 
            path. Again, I began to feel discomfort as I didn't want to waste time or admit failure. 
            I decided that if I at least possessed natural managerial skills and was doing well in 
            my classes, it would mean I could be successful in my career and hopefully begin to 
            be enthusiastic about it. So I pushed on as I took an emphasis in Supply Chain Management 
            which seemed the most interesting compared to that of "General Management" and "HR".
          </p>
          <p>
            It was finally time to graduate. I was done with school and it was time for life to move 
            forward another step. Most people would be happy and relieved. However, this was the most 
            frightening and anxious time for me. It was too late to take back any decisions, and I 
            felt my life's path was set in stone. Gradually, I begin to be filled with regret. As I 
            started going to interviews, I was questioned with, "Why?". Such a simple and basic question, 
            yet I found it impossible to answer honestly. I thought to myself, I became a Supply Chain 
            Management major because I was above-average at it. But how come I can't land a job from 
            these interviews? I began to slowly learn the importance of desire.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all these years, I avoided the simplest question of all, "What do you want to do, Justin?". 
            I am so focused on the "What am I good at?", "What is acceptable to your parents?" and the 
            "What is likely possible?" that I ignored the simple idea of desire. One random day, I 
            broke in front of my parents whom I valued their opinions greatly. Scared to be criticized, I 
            wondered how much they'd be disappointed. After a long conversation, I had learned for the 
            first time what my parents truly wanted for me. I had always thought there was this expectation 
            I had to meet for them to be satisfied. But they told me that they would only be satisfied if I 
            was satisfied. They told me to not be scared of regret or wasting time; moreover, that there 
            was no such thing. "You are young. Don't worry about what anyone thinks. Make every experience 
            and moment count, even if it means realizing you made a mistake," my dad said. It was the 
            first time I had felt like I had control over my life. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I decided to take a risk and try taking a data analytics boot camp course under Georgia Tech. I was
            always interested in coding and programming. As of today, I am halfway through the course and haved loved 
            every bit of it. I created this website as a side project and plan to continue to add on new things 
            I have learned.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two things I believe that should be taken into consideration. What are you good at, and 
            what do you want to do? It's important to find a balance and compromise. I definitely have learned 
            many skills and tools as well as develop myself as a person through my time as a Supply Chain 
            Management student. There were also many interesting projects and lessons that have made me advantageous. 
            I don't regret my decisions. I don't regret going to UGA and majoring in Business. 
            I don't regret accepting admission as a Management student. I don't regret emphasizing in Supply 
            Chain Management. Every thing I did served a purpose and it got me to where I am today.
