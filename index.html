  <p>
    Hello, my name is Justin Moon and I am 22 years old. I am currently taking a gtech data camp that is teaching me about basic programming languages and data tools to improve my skillset and prepare me for jobs in data science.
  </p>
  <p>
    I graduated from the University of Georgia in 2019 with a BBA in Supply Chain Management. I always believed I had potential to be a good manager as I grew up in many leadership roles and worked with teams in my church. I felt that I should pursue a career that focuses on that skillset.
