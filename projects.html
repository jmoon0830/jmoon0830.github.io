            My team decided to find out what happened with each sector in the market during the COVID-19
            pandemic. The data assumes the first 6 months of the year 2020 (Jan 1, 2020 to Jun 30, 2020) to 
            have been affected by the pandemic. Our assumption was that the tech sector would have seen a 
            growth during the pandemic whereas sectors that require contact and retail would have declined.
          </p>
          <p>
            After using API calls to retrieve the stock data available at <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha Vantage</a>, 
            we used Python to clean the data and build data frames. Next, we calculated quarterly percentages from 
            2015 to 2019 as we began to compare the changes between sectors. We also calculated the average predicted 
            growth using a linear regression model.
          </p>
          <p>
            The tech sector had grown as expected; however, we were shocked to find that the real estate sector had 
            equally grown as much.

            The purpose of this project was to showcase our ability to extract, transform, and load data 
            otherwise known as ETL. We decided to choose the topic of video games and separated our data 
            into three segments. First, we used the livestreaming website, Twitch, and its developer tool 
            that allows us to perform API calls to pull in the top live games being played on its 
            <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/"> website </a>. Our next data source was from IGDB which is a video 
            game database that we used to webscrape the top games based on ratings and reviews by critics. 
            Our last data source was from a public dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> which 
            contains videogame sales and playtime information. We cleaned the data so that it could be useable 
            for any person interested in such information and loaded into a SQL databased using Postgres SQL.

            This project analyzes <a href="">Kaggle Data</a> containing survey answers on questions surrounding mental health in the workplace. The first section of the app displays the data and can be filtered by state.
            The second section contains a geojson map that color coordinates based on amount of people surveyed in each state. Dark red signifies larger while gray signifies lesser people. The third 
            section compares answers surrounding mental health comfortability between 2014 and 2016. The last section compares the gender ratio of males and females who answered "Yes" to 
            having family history of mental health issues.

            My team and I decided to apply our machine learning knowledge to scrape data for Yelp's website and API to create 
            a model that will apply sentiment analysis to a searched business's reviews. Our goal was to create dynamic 
            charts that visualized ratings and create word clouds that visualized frequeny words. Later, we decided to use ngrams 
            to not only signifiy repeated words but also commonly repeated phrases.
