          My team decided to find out what happened with each sector in the market during the COVID-19
          pandemic. The data assumes the first 6 months of the year 2020 (Jan 1, 2020 to Jun 30, 2020) to 
          have been affected by the pandemic. Our assumption was that the tech sector would have seen a 
          growth during the pandemic whereas sectors that require contact and retail would have declined.
        </p>
        <p>
          After using API calls to retrieve the stock data available at <a href="https://www.alphavantage.co/">Alpha Vantage</a>, 
          we used Python to clean the data and build data frames. Next, we calculated quarterly percentages from 
          2015 to 2019 as we began to compare the changes between sectors. We also calculated the average predicted 
          growth using a linear regression model.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech sector had grown as expected; however, we were shocked to find that the real estate sector had 
          equally grown as much.

          The purpose of this project was to showcase our ability to extract, transform, and load data 
          otherwise known as ETL. We decided to choose the topic of video games and separated our data 
          into three segments. First, we used the livestreaming website, Twitch, and its developer tool 
          that allows us to perform API calls to pull in the top live games being played on its 
          <a href="www.twitch.tv/"> website </a>. Our next data source was from IGDB which is a video 
          game database that we used to webscrape the top games based on ratings and reviews by critics. 
          Our last data source was from a public dataset from <a href="www.kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> which 
          contains videogame sales and playtime information. We cleaned the data so that it could be useable 
          for any person interested in such information and loaded into a SQL databased using Postgres SQL.
